Challenge 2: 
The engineers building an amusement park have lost all their calculators!
Create a 4 function calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations 
(addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers. 
The program should demonstrate the use of different data types, variables, and operations. 
*/

/*
Parameters: 
1) Variable 1 - double 
2) Variable 2 - double 
3) Operator (+ - * /) - char
Output:
The function will return the result of the operation.

Example:
Input: 5, 3, +
Output: 8

Tip: You may need if statements to check which operator to use and then perform the correct operation.
