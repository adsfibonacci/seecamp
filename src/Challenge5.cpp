Challenge 5:
The parts for your roller coasters are manufactured in europe so thier weight measurments are in metric units!
Your tasked with converting all the measurements to imperial units and finding the total weight of the parts.
Write a function that takes in an array of parts weights in kg and returns the total weight in lbs.
Write a helper function to do the conversion! 

Tip: The conversion rate is 1 kg = 2.20462 lbs. You will need to call the helper function convertToLbs() 
in the total weight function.




Parameters:
1) Weight in kgs - double

Returns:
Weight in lbs - double
*/

double convertToLbs(double weight){
    //add code here
  return -1;
}

/*
Parameters:
1) Parts weight in kgs - Array of doubles

Returns:
Total weight in lbs - double
*/
double totalWeight(double partsWeights[], int numParts) {
    //add code here
  return -1;
}
